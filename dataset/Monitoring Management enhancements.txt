Monitoring Management enhancements
Generate alert for the resources with unknown availability state
A client-level critical alert will be generated every 30 minutes if a resource availability state changes to the UNKNOWN state.

The alert is auto healed when all the resources in the alert move out of the UNKNOWN state.

See Resource Availability for more details.

Removing an existing monitor and adding a new monitor with configuration parameters to the template:

When you remove an existing monitor from the template and add a new monitor with configuration parameters, the old configurations are removed from all the resources associated with that template and the new configuration parameters will be pushed. Prior to this, the newly added parameters were not pushed to the resources.

Device management policy view template configuration parameters:

When you remove the existing monitor from the template, the configuration parameters for that monitor will be removed from the device management policy view page. Prior to this, the device management view page still showed the configuration parameter from the removed monitor
