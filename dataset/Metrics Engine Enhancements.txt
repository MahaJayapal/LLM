Metrics Engine Enhancements
Metric Name length limit increased
The metric name size has been increased to 255 characters, and you can now utilize up to 10 underscores within this limit. Previously, only 100 characters were permitted with a maximum of 5 underscores.

With this extended limit, you can now create more descriptive metric names that accommodate various makes, models, and version details.

See Metric Name format for more details.
